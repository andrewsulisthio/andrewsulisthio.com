My passion for efficient systems led me to launch Redaco System Factory in 2016, where I've completed numerous freelance web projects with a focus on maintainable, future-proof code ([DRY, YAGNI](https://www.instagram.com/p/CG3po7mhGaS), and [SOLID](https://www.instagram.com/p/CG6bWhbhLib) principles). This experience honed my attention to detail, a quality that extends to my work sourcing auction-grade coffees for [TÜR Coffee Co](https://www.behance.net/gallery/170303999/TUR), my 2022 venture. Whether building web systems or serving international coffee connoisseurs, my dedication to quality remains unwavering.

I optimize my body and mind with the same precision as I debug code, tackle high-difficulty FromSoftware games, and source auction-grade coffee beans – always seeking peak performance. My dedication to self-improvement includes:
- **Fitness**: Butterfly swimming, 5K runs under 30 minutes, enhancing both physical and mental resilience
- **Discipline**: Regular caffeine fasts to maintain sensitivity and occasional water-only fasts to promote autophagy and boost long-term cellular health
- **Community**: Sharing my passion for gaming through [streaming and recorded content](https://www.twitch.tv/heinja)
